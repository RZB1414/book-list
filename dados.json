        "descricao": "I absolutely loved the book 'Foundation' by Isaac Asimov. It's a timeless masterpiece that captivated me from start to finish.\n Asimov's vision of a crumbling Galactic Empire and the birth of a new civilization is brilliantly executed. The intricate plot filled with political intrigue and the clash of ideologies kept me on the edge of my seat.\nI was fascinated by the concept of psychohistory and how Hari Seldon's predictions shaped the course of history. The way Asimov seamlessly weaves together science and fiction is simply remarkable.\nThe characters, while some may argue lacked depth, felt real and relatable to me. I was emotionally invested in their journeys and their struggles to navigate a hanging universe.\nThe vastness of the universe created by Asimov and the thought-provoking themes it explores left a lasting impact on me. 'Foundation' is a true classic that has stood the test of time, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys epic science fiction sagas."
